This is the main package we will use. It has all the codes and stuff.
To make things easier i made a launch file its in launch/robot_launch.launch
Make sure to add all the scripts we will run to the file in the same format as the others for the final stage
If you want to revert to the rosserial you can run it in another window and remove the MQTT_Bridge from the launch file
